## What I Am Making

- I have created a mock website for a painter.
- I used ReactJS and NextJS to create this project.
- Included is a home page, an about page and a gallery page.

## What I learned

- Page design is very nice in NextJS.
- Along with the Link and Image components makes switching and controlling page visitation much easier and cleaner to write.
- The load in for Image components is nice because of the layout functions and the public folder access.

## What I want to Work On

- Building websites utilizing the layout component more.
